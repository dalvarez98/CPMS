Built the project using C#.net, Razor Pages, and SQL

This project represents a fully functioning website to help manage a database of conference papers from authors and reviewers. 
This was done to eliminate the need for the physical delivery of these papers from authors to our client Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges Midwest.
